; A QTM specification that solves Deutsch's problem.
; This specification implements an oracle machine M0 that computes: (f(x) = x) xor y
;
; Deutsch's problem seeks to determine whether a function implemented by some oracle is constant or balanced.
; This machine is actaully a composition of two machines, M1 and M0.
; M0 represents the oracle machine.
; M1 represents the machine that calls the oracle and examines its output to determine if the function it implements
;  is balanced or constant.
;
; M1: put the input x into superposition
